Important:
  - structured logging output
  - performance tuning and benchmarking, FUSE needs some options + larger local ephemeral cache for reads
  - support for private / authenticated repos (forward credentials)

Nice to have / low priority:
  - Integration test improvements
    - Health check endpoint to avoid time.sleep in the test
    - Stream logs from mirrorface while it runs (background thread)
    - Graceful shutdown of mirrorface
    - Code cleanups, it's bit hacky
    - create some dummy model files that can be loaded with transofmers lib? (simpler testing, can point to that one instead of real model)
  - (maybe) unit tests for the serving code?
