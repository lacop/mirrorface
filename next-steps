Important:
  - helm chart
  - deploy to GKE autopilot cluster to test the fuse gcs csi thing, performance tuning etc
  - some benchmarking on huge model on real GKE pod
  - implement metrics
  - structured logging output
  - github CI:
      - docker+helm build and push GCR
      - run pyright, pytest, integration tests
      - run precommit lints

Nice to have / low priority:
  - Integration test improvements
    - Health check endpoint to avoid time.sleep in the test
    - Stream logs from mirrorface while it runs (background thread)
    - Graceful shutdown of mirrorface
    - Code cleanups, it's bit hacky
    - create some dummy model files that can be loaded with transofmers lib? (simpler testing, can point to that one instead of real model)
  - (maybe) unit tests for the serving code?
  - running "mirror" without repo install using `uvx --from github... mirror` ?
