- integration test with server+client, proxy mode
  - two networks, get client talking to server
  - validate server is proxying requests
  - graceful shutdown of server

- storage / manifests structs and library/tests
- CLI tool to download to local dir (no GCS yet)

- serving from local dir/manifests
- integration test with server+client, local mode
  - download first into local dir
  - server has no network
  - client still works

- create some dummy model files that can be loaded with transofmers lib?
  - simpler testing, can point to that one instead of real model

- GCS upload option in the CLI tool

- (maybe) unit tests for the serving code?

- helm chart
- deploy to GKE autopilot cluster to test the fuse gcs csi thing, performance tuning etc
- some benchmarking on huge model on real GKE pod

- implement metrics
- structured logging output
